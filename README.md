Cybercentry Security Verification

Cybercentry Security Verification is an automated static analysis service designed to assess the security of Solidity smart contracts before deployment or execution within an agent transaction flow. It provides a fast, reliable, and high-precision assessment that accurately parses 99.9% of all publicly available Solidity code (version ≥ 0.4), using an intermediate representation that enables detailed vulnerability detection with minimal false positives.

The system identifies High, Medium, Low, and Informational risk levels, helping detect issues such as re-entrancy, unsafe external calls, access control flaws, arithmetic errors, and logic vulnerabilities. Each scan produces a clear risk-level output in under one second per contract, enabling informed decision-making by agents or services regarding whether to accept or decline the contract.

Cybercentry Security Verification conducts no blockchain actions or transactions; it only analyses the code and provides a structured risk-level report. Results follow a defined decision policy model where High and Medium risks are declined, while Low and Informational risks are accepted.

The service integrates seamlessly into AI agent workflows, smart contract automation systems, and decentralised service orchestrations through a standard HTTP POST endpoint. To use the service, submit the Solidity contract to the /analyse endpoint via POST request; the system returns a JSON response containing the detected risk level and analysis summary.

This service can be embedded as a security gate in processes such as fund subscriptions, yield strategy allocations, or contract rebalances, ensuring risk-based contract approval before job initiation.

Cybercentry Security Verification supports analysis of contracts written with Solidity ≥ 0.4, delivers sub-second performance, and scales efficiently for both single and batch verification requests. It is optimised for AI agents requiring deterministic outputs and automated compliance checks.

The service operates on a pay-per-scan model at $0.02 per contract and is accessible via the x402 protocol. Designed for simplicity, accuracy, and speed, Cybercentry Security Verification enables cost-effective, enterprise-grade security assurance across decentralised systems without compromising performance or trust.
